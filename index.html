        <p>Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and
            one of the most influential men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published
            in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science.</p><br>

            <p>Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy
                equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for
                his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
                effect.</p><br>

            <p>Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important scientist and
                inventor of the modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many
                revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th
                centuries.</p><br>
